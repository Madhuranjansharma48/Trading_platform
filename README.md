# Trading_platform

A production-grade, real-time trading web application that enables users to register, securely place trades, and view live order books and trade history. The system handles complex order matching, real-time updates, concurrent transactions, and robust security.

🌟 Features
User Management: Secure registration and authentication with JWT tokens

Real-Time Order Book: Live order book updates via WebSocket connections

Order Matching Engine: Efficient price-time priority matching for market and limit orders

Trade Execution: Automatic trade execution when orders match

RESTful APIs: Comprehensive API for all trading operations

React Frontend: Responsive web interface with real-time updates

Dockerized Environment: Containerized development and production setup

HTTPS Security: Secure communication with self-signed certificates for development

Database Persistence: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM integration

📋 Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

Docker (version 20.10+)

Docker Compose (version 2.0+)

OpenSSL (for generating SSL certificates)

🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone the Repository
bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd trading-platform
2. Generate SSL Certificates
bash
mkdir ssl
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
  -keyout ssl/localhost.key -out ssl/localhost.crt \
  -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"
3. Build and Start the Application
bash
docker-compose up --build
This command will:

Build the backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) containers

Start PostgreSQL database

Set up NGINX with HTTPS

Initialize all services

4. Access the Application
Frontend: https://localhost

API Documentation: https://localhost/api/v1/docs

Backend API: https://localhost/api/v1

Note: Your browser will warn about the self-signed certificate. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed to localhost" to continue.

🔧 API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /api/v1/users/ - Register a new user

POST /api/v1/token - Login and receive JWT token

Orders
POST /api/v1/orders/ - Place a new order (buy/sell)

DELETE /api/v1/orders/{order_id} - Cancel an order

GET /api/v1/orders/ - List user's orders

Trades
GET /api/v1/trades/ - List user's trade history

WebSocket
WS /api/v1/ws/orderbook - Real-time order book updates

🎯 Order Matching Algorithm
The order book uses a priority-based matching algorithm:

Buy Orders: Max-heap implementation (highest price first)

Sell Orders: Min-heap implementation (lowest price first)

Matching Logic: Price-time priority - orders at the same price are prioritized by time of arrival

Trade Execution: Immediate execution when buy price ≥ sell price

🛠️ Development
Running Tests
bash
docker-compose exec backend pytest
Code Formatting
bash
# Format Python code
docker-compose exec backend black .

# Lint Python code
docker-compose exec backend flake8
Database Management
bash
# Access PostgreSQL database
docker-compose exec db psql -U user trading_db

# Reset database (clears all data)
docker-compose down
docker volume rm trading-platform_postgres_data
docker-compose up
VS Code Setup
The project includes optimized VS Code configuration:

Install recommended extensions from .vscode/extensions.json

Debug configurations for both backend and frontend

Task definitions for common operations

Code snippets for FastAPI and SQLAlchemy

🔒 Security Features
Password hashing with bcrypt

JWT-based authentication

HTTPS with TLS encryption

Input validation and sanitization

SQL injection prevention through ORM

CORS protection

📊 Database Schema
https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Database+Schema+Diagram

The database consists of three main tables:

Users: User account information

Orders: Buy/sell orders with status tracking

Trades: Executed trade records

🚀 Deployment
Production Considerations
Replace SSL certificates with trusted certificates (e.g., Let's Encrypt)

Set strong JWT secret in environment variables

Configure database backups

Set up monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)

Implement rate limiting

Use production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers)

Environment Variables
Key environment variables to configure:

bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@db:5432/trading_db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256

🆘 Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Port already in use: Change ports in docker-compose.yml

Certificate errors: Accept the security exception in your browser

Build failures: Check Docker logs for specific error messages

Database connection issues: Ensure PostgreSQL container is running

Getting Help
If you encounter issues:

Check the Docker logs: docker-compose logs [service]

Ensure all prerequisites are installed

Verify SSL certificates are properly generated
